The client for this project is the Administration Department at **AutoBox** having over a thousand employees.

They want to maintain a **central database** of all of their employees.
And, extra emphasis is on **increasing security** and ease of operation.
The idea is to create a **web-based app for Facial Recognition** in order to have rightful entry to the office premises and restrict any trespassers.
Once the employees are identified on a daily basis, they can have a simple entry and exit procedure without any manual intervention.They want to deal with their existing employeeâ€™s database and those coming in as a new recruit.

**Current Practice:**

The existing employees or the ones joining the Company gets a card having a QR(RFID) code with unique identification for entry and exit.

**The current practice suffers from the following problems:**

- This approach is too haphazard. The quality of **insight gained is misaligned** due to misleading data.
- The second problem is these **insights can't be aggregated** to frame certain policies on this.
- The third problem is the **security breach of the Company**, which can hamper the situation very badly.

As a part of the **digital approach**, the Admin Department hires **INSAIDians** as their **AI consultant** in order to supplement their security protocols with a more proactive approach.



### **Weekly Goals for the team?**:
The AI consultant team will follow the below week-wise goals,
